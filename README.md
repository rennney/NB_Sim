# NB_Sim
This package provides an implementation of nonlinear normal mode analysis based on rigid blocks for macromolecular systems â€” including proteins, complexes, and large assemblies.  It implements the NOLB method from Hoffmann &amp; Grudinin (2017), using sparse matrix algebra and GPU-accelerated extrapolation [TODO].
